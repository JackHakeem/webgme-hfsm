# webgme-hfsm

WebGME App for creating Executable Heirarchical Finite State Machines (HFSMs)

This repository contains the plugins and base seed for creating HFSMs with embedded c/c++ 
code in each state (for `initialization`, the state's periodic `state function`, and the 
`exiting` the state).  The WebGME app utilizes the 
[CodeEditor](https://github.com/finger563/webgme-codeeditor) to allow users to edit the 
code for the model as if it were part of an IDE.
